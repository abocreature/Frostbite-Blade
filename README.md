Long ago, I built a character around a cantrip from a neat little mod called Frostbite Blade. Sadly that mod no longer functions as of Patch 8, and with no word from the author on updating it. So I decided to make one myself.



Introducing Rimefrost Blade. Built from the ground up using the now official Booming Blade as a base with a lot of cleanup and proper elemental tags and custom VFX.

Leaves enemies with a condition that damages them for 1d8 cold damage upon their next attack roll. Starting at level 5, it'll add 1d8 cold damage to the base attack and increase the condition damage to 2d8. At level 11 (inline with base game Booming Blade), upgrades to 2d8/3d8. Available to Wizards, Warlocks, Sorcerers and Druids.



Should theoretically work with any level 20 mod that incorporates base Booming Blade, though this hasn't been tested. Responsibly adds itself to the appropriate spell lists and will be compatible with any mod that does the same.
